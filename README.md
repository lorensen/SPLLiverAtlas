# SPLLiverAtlas
The Brigham and Women's Surgical Planning Lab Liver Atlas
Derived from a clinical quality CT scan, this SPL Liver Atlas features the liver, liver vasculature, other large vessels, and abdominal organs.

Description
The Liver Atlas is a joint project between the Department of Radiology, Boston Medical Center and the Surgical Planning Laboratory, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School. The project was initiated by Dr. Kitt Shaffer, Vice-Chair for Education in Radiology at BMC, and Dr. Sonia Pujol, Director of 3D Slicer Training & Education. The atlas was derived from a computed tomography (CT) scan, using semi-automated image segmentation and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques. The data set consists of the original CT scan, a set of detailed label maps (including liver segments), a set of three-dimensional models of the labeled anatomical structures, and an anatomical model hierarchy.
